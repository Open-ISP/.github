## Overview

This project aims to provide open and accessible energy modelling tools that enable high-quality research and analysis of potential energy transition pathways for Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM).

A core objective is to produce an open-source capacity expansion modelling tool based on the methodology and assumptions used by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to produce their [Integrated System Plan](https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/major-publications/integrated-system-plan-isp/2024-integrated-system-plan-isp). To achieve this, the project: 
- Provides tools to access and readily use AEMO’s inputs and assumptions.
- Leverages an existing open-source electricity modelling framework ([PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/)) to model operation and cost-optimal generation and transmission expansion in the NEM using AEMO’s or user-specified inputs and assumptions.

Two other key objectives of the project are:
- Improving the accessibility of energy system modelling to researchers and energy sector stakeholders through extensive documentation and supporting material.
- Making modelling reproducible through metadata that tracks inputs, assumptions and the model version. 

## Funding
The OpenISP project is supported by a philanthropic grant from [Boundless Earth](https://www.boundless.earth/).
